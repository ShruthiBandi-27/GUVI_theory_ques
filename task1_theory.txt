Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2

1. HTTP/1.1 : It is developed as a communication standard for the World Wide Web.
HTTP/2 : It began as the SPDY protocol ,developed with intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression,multiplexing and prioritization.

2. HTTP/1.1 : It keeps all requests and responses in plain text format.
HTTP/2 : It uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format.

3. HTTP/1.1 : It loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. 
HTTP/2 : It is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource
