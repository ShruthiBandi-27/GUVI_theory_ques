Objects in JS:

 Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

Internal representation of objects in JS:

The objects in JS can be created in following ways:

1) We can creat JavaScript Object with Object Literal and can define the property and values inside curly braces.

Ex:
let fruit = {name:'apple', colour: 'red', place:'kashmir'};

2) We can create JS objects with Constructor

The Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same flavors.

Ex: 
function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = name;
   this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)


3) We can create JS object with new keyword

Ex: 
var person = new Object();
person.firstName = “Shruthi”;
person.lastName = “Bandi”;
person.age = 50;
